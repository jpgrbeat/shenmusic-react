      <p>Finding an instrument for that little booger picker can be such a pain in the ass! We Know! We met them when they came in. You could drop them on the curb outside of a seedy alley when they start talking about that extra expense of getting a tuba and the thought of listening to them struggle note by note through some John Susa bullshit is probably already giving you a headache, but we can help you do the humane thing and maybe even save you some money in the process with our low price rental gaurentee. It's never too soon to hope for an anuerism, fill out the rental form today!</p>
